== Welcome to XML Amsterdam

=== Around the world in … ~22 hours

Because I’m crazy, that’s why.

* Say something _profound_
* Or say something _reflective_

=== What to say, what to say?

[#frag1]
* XML in a non-XML world?
* Non-XML in an XML world?
* Hence the title

=== Practical (Non)XML

[#frag2]
* Why XML?
* Why not XML?
* It’s all XML, some of it is just weirdly serialized
* And what if you could do more?
* With fun demos!

== Why XML?

=== It’s the structure, stupid

* I’ve trained myself to think in terms of structure
* Structure is absolutely essential for reuse
** Using the same content in different documents
** Using the same content in different contexts
* _Everyone_ wants reuse

== Why Not XML?

=== It’s the stupid structure

* It’s too complex
* It’s too verbose
* It’s too draconian
* It’s hard to produce
* It’s hard to consume
  ** Doesn’t map nicely to programming language data structures

== No, XML!

* It’s complex enough to capture rich document structures (mixed content)
* It allows (requires) the author to speak with precision
* It’s always better to be correct
* It’s hard to produce/consume with non-XML tools
  ** Patient: “Doctor, doctor, it hurts when I scratch my elbow.”
  ** Doctor: “Then stop scratching your elbow.”

== Hierarchy of projects

[#frag11]
* Tens of very big projects. Very big budgets. Very sensitive to error.
* Hundreds of big projects. Big budgets. Sensitive to error.
* Thousands of smaller projects. Small budgets. Less sensitive to error.
* Millions of small projects. No budgets. Mostly insensitive to error.
* This is what winning looks like, by the way.

== The simplest thing

=== The simplest thing that could possibly work

* If all you need are:
  ** Atomic values
  ** Lists of atomic values
  ** Key/values pairs (associative arrays, hashes, “objects”)

▼

=== JSON is simple

* No elements
* No attributes
* No namespaces
* No mixed content
* A paucity of data types
* “Just” objects, arrays, and scalar values

=== JSON is “just data”

It maps directly to programming language concepts that
are provided “natively” by most programming languages
and well understood by most programmers.

=== With schemas…

....
{
	"title": "Example Schema",
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"firstName": {
			"type": "string"
		},
		"lastName": {
			"type": "string"
		},
		"age": {
			"description": "Age in years",
			"type": "integer",
			"minimum": 0
		}
	},
	"required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
}
....

=== And namespaces (sortof)…

....
{
    "@id": "http://store.example.com/",
    "@type": "Store",
    "name": "Links Bike Shop",
    "description": "The most \"linked\" bike store on earth!",
    "product": [
        {
            "@id": "p:links-swift-chain",
            "@type": "Product",
            "name": "Links Swift Chain",
            "description": "A fine chain with many links.",
            "category": ["cat:parts", "cat:chains"],
            "price": "10.00",
            "stock": 10
        }
    ],
    "@context": {
        "Store": "http://ns.example.com/store#Store",
        "Product": "http://ns.example.com/store#Product",
        "product": "http://ns.example.com/store#product",
        "category":
        {
          "@id": "http://ns.example.com/store#category",
          "@type": "@id"
        },
        "price": "http://ns.example.com/store#price",
        "stock": "http://ns.example.com/store#stock",
        "name": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title",
        "description": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/description",
        "p": "http://store.example.com/products/",
        "cat": "http://store.example.com/category/"
    }
}
....

But I digress.

=== Simple is better

[#frag3]
* Simplicity is rarely an absolute
* Making some things simpler almost _always_ makes other things more complicated
* Complexity creeps up on you

=== Demo

AWS CloudFormation templates

=== JSON template (1/2)

....
{
    "AWSTemplateFormatVersion": "2010-09-09",
    "Description": "MarkLogic Sample  Template:: Build Date: NDW HVM 8.0.1",
    "Parameters": {
        "AdminUser": {
            "Description": "The MarkLogic Administrator Username",
            "Type": "String"
        },
....

It all looks fairly reasonable, until…

=== JSON template (2/2)

....
            "UserData": {"Fn::Base64": {"Fn::Join": [
                "",
                [
                    "#!/bin/bash\n",
                    "function error_exit\n",
                    "{\n",
                    "     logger -t MarkLogic  \"$1\"",
....

* Funny key names with implied semantics
* No multi-line strings

=== XML template (1/2)

....
<object xmlns="http://marklogic.com/xdmp/json/basic"
      xmlns:AWS="http://amazon.com/aws"
      xmlns:MarkLogic="http://marklogic.com/ns">
   <AWSTemplateFormatVersion>2010-09-09</AWSTemplateFormatVersion>
   <Description>MarkLogic Sample  Template:: Build Date: NDW HVM 8.0.1</Description>
   <Parameters>
      <AdminUser>
         <Description>The MarkLogic Administrator Username</Description>
         <Type>String</Type>
      </AdminUser>
....

I totally made up this XML vocabulary

=== XML template (2/2)

....
            <UserData encoding="base64">
#!/bin/bash

function error_exit
{
  logger -t MarkLogic  "$1"
  exit 1
}
....
=== JSON error

....
[Error: Parse error on line 342:
...}        }    }}
-------------------^
Expecting '}', ',', got 'EOF']
....

* Very, uhm, “helpful”

=== XML error

....
cftemp.xml:203: parser error :
   Opening and ending tag mismatch: UserData line 173 and Properties
         </Properties>
....

* Missing end tag precisely identified

== Verbosity

=== XML inputs

* XML is too verbose
* XML is too hard to type
* Why do I have to quote attribute values?
* Why do I have to have matching end tags?

▼

=== Simpler inputs

* Simpler input formats are all the rage
** What’s your favorite MarkDown flavor this week?
* This is not a new concept

=== To prove this point

I wrote a JSON parser…

[#frag1b]
in SGML

=== You did what now?

[quote, B. Tommie Usdin]
First of all: YOU ARE NUTS! Creative, ingenious, and NUTS!

[quote, Debbie Lapeyre]
By the by, did I bother to tell you that this is ingenious. And yes,
you can do it. Aaaaaaqaaaaaaaaargh! You are one very sick puppy


=== Remember: In SGML…

[#frag4]
1. You _must_ have a schema (a DTD)
2. You are allowed to omit (some) start and end tags
3. Structures can span across entity boundaries
4. You can write a state machines with `SHORTREF`

== It’s not simple enough

image::lessobsessive.png[Less obsessive tweet,link=https://twitter.com/marijnjh/status/651677587178131456]

== Thoughts on writing

* Some folks say you can’t write in XML:

image::despite-hl.png[Despite the fact…,link=http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/#converting-a-document-to-docbook]

* Generally speaking, [NSFW –ed]
* I assert that structure aids my writing

== Non-XML XML Authoring

* MarkDown
** CommonMark
** GitHub
** Flavor of the week
* AsciiDoc
** AsciiDoctor

== Why?

* Simpler is better
* HTML5 isn’t helping authors

== It’s not markup

image::notmarkup.png[Not markup tweet,link=https://twitter.com/mollydotcom/status/654712233331560448]

image::dislikehtml5.png[Dislike HTML5 tweet,link=https://twitter.com/mollydotcom/status/654717106492080130]

== The modern web

* HTML5
* JavaScript
** JQuery
** Angular
* CSS
** Sass
* Analytics

It’s frameworks all the way down

== Authoring

=== My typical methodology


* Write in DocBook, or some customization
* Convert to HTML with CSS and JavaScript for presentation
* Convert to PDF for print
* Refactor, reuse, repurpose, restyle with ease

▼

=== Methodology for this talk

* Was written entirely in AsciiDoc
* Formatted by AsciiDoctor into DocBook 5
* Transformed by XSLT into HTML5
* Displayed with http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/[Reveal.JS]

****
* AsciiDoctor for something real
* Still using DocBook because I have tooling
* Reveal.JS is modern and useful and I don’t have to maintain it!
****

=== I have concerns

* For simple content, “markdown” is easier
* But for complex content…

=== It’s all a bit ad hoc

== JSON revisited

=== What is JSON?

[#frag7]
* JSON is structured markup
* We have good tools for leveraging document structure
* What if we could use them on JSON?

[#frag9]

=== XPath over JSON

....
{
  "a": {
    "b" : "v1",
    "c1" : 1,
    "d" : null,
    "g" : ["s1", "s2", "s3"]
  }
}
....

* `/a/b` = `"v1"`
* `/a/g` = `("s1", "s2", "s3")`
* `/a/g[2]` = `"s2"` _❔_

****
Remember that /a/b always returns a sequence
sorted in document order
****

=== XPath over JSON (continued)

....
{
  "a": {
    "b" : "v1",
    "c1" : 1,
    "d" : null,
    "g" : ["s1", "s2", "s3"]
  }
}
....

* `/a/d` = `null` _❔_
* `/a/g[1]/node-name()` = `g` _❔_
* `/a/g[2]/node-name()` = `g` _❔_

=== Demo

JSON in MarkLogic Server

=== JavaScript+JSON in MarkLogic Server

....
var json = xdmp.documentGet("/projects/presentations/2015/11-xmlams/cf/cftemp.json").next().value.toObject()

json["Resources"]["InstanceSecurityGroup"]["Type"]
....

* Returns “`AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`”

=== XPath over JSON in MarkLogic Server

....
xquery version "1.0-ml";

let $json := xdmp:document-get("/projects/presentations/2015/11-xmlams/cf/cftemp.json")
return
  $json//InstanceSecurityGroup/Type
....

* Returns “`AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`”

== Did XML lose?
